Desktop application design

- Source files are placed in src folder.
- Build folder includes compiled css files and was created to check result in browser.
- Font size was checked in photopea.com.
- I used just sans-serif fonts instead of downloading specific font (I sent question about it).
- Mobile design wasn't provided so responsiveness is created just in way to display all content on mobile devices (without any additional changes like moving filters to the top   etc.).
